## Testing

The project uses **Jest** for unit testing. Tests cover all core business logic functions.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Test Coverage
- Adding valid expenses
- Rejecting invalid input
- Calculating totals correctly
- Removing expenses by ID
- Filtering expenses by category

## CI/CD Pipeline

![GitHub Actions CI](assets/Github2.png)

The project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration. The pipeline automatically:
- Runs on every push to `main` or any `feat/*` branch
- Runs on every pull request to `main`
- Sets up Node.js environment
- Installs dependencies
- Executes all Jest tests

View the pipeline status in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/KofiAckah/budget-buddy/actions).

## Git Workflow

This project follows a **feature branch workflow**:

### Branches
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `feat/setup-core-logic` - Sprint 1: Core expense tracking
- `feat/delete-expense` - Sprint 2: Delete functionality
- `feat/filter-category` - Sprint 2: Category filtering

### Workflow Process
1. Create a feature branch from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make changes and commit frequently with descriptive messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add expense deletion feature"
   ```
3. Push to GitHub
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Create a Pull Request
5. Wait for CI to pass (green checkmark)
6. Merge to `main`
